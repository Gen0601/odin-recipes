    <h1>Kalderetang Kambing (Goat Stew)</h1>
    <p>
        When you pair the unique flavors of liver with vinegar, tomato sauce, onions and carrots, you get the ever so lovely taste of Kaldereta. This orange stew is a Filipino recipe that locals truly love for its rich texture and powerful savory taste. But while there are a great deal of Kaldereta variants out there, the traditional version actually uses the semi-sweet goat meat for its protein. And if you want to learn how to make it with this distinctly delicious type of meat, come and cook some Kalderetang Kambing with me!

    <h2>Amazing Kalderetang Kambing</h2>
    <p>
        Kaldereta actually refers to a dish wherein we stew goat meat in tomato sauce and a mix of other components. And we do it in a metal pot, or of course, the “kaldero”. Like many of our favorite Filipino dishes, this recipe is actually adapted from the Spanish when they colonized the country. But over time, we’ve tailored it to our taste, and it’s become a well-loved home-cooked Filipino viand.

        <li>Add the water and allow to boil. Simmer for at least 45 minutes or until the meat is tender.</li>
        <li>Add the liver spread and cook for 5 minutes (You may add water if the sauce seems to dry up)</li>
        <li>Put-in the potatoes and carrots then simmer for 8 minutes.</li>
